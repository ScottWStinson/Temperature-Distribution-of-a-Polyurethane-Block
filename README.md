# Temperature-Distribution-of-a-Polyurethane-Block

This MATLAB program shows in table form, the temperature distribution
of a polyurethane block used as insulation for a heat sink.
This model is a two dimensional-steady state summation developed using
separation of variables. Boundary conditions of the block are:
Top temperature is 60 C, 3 sides(right, left, bottom) are 20 C.
